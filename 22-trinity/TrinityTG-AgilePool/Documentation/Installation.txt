Installation 

1. Provision a web service from a service provider or make sure Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) is installed on your local system. We used a free version of Microsoft Azure web service https://azure.microsoft.com/ for this prototype.

2. Provision a SQL server. We used Azure SQL server

3. Install Microsoft SQL Studio on your computer. We use a free trial version 

4. Install Visual Studio 2015

5. Run the SQL scripts in the SQL folder to create tables and store procedures. There are four files and they are numbered. Please run them in that order:
    a.	1-DeleteALLStoreProcs.sql
    b.	2-DropALLTables.sql
    c.	3-CreateALLTables.sql
    d.	4-CreateALLStoreProcs.sql
    
6.	Download the solution from GitHub to your local system

7.	Load the solution (AgileVendorPool.sln) into Visual Studio 2015

8.	In the Web.Config file, edit the "connectionStrings" and point it to either your remote SQL server or your local SQL server

That is it. 

Now you can run the application.
