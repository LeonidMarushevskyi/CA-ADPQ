Bruce walked Yuri through the prototype: Eamonn and Noelle took notes

HSS Prototype
Profile page

Yuri's suggestion: Add an Alert saying "this is a secure system - OK to send PIAA/HIPPA"

Discussed sophistication of their end users.  Yuri: it varies, prior to smart phones, there was a lack of connectivity and PCs in many foster homes.  Now, Yuri sees high adoption of smart phones, and there are still not a lot of desktop computers.

Bruce demonstrated the Reactive design of the web-site on an iPhone 6 form factor.  It looked great!

The initial version of the Profile page includes a section for adding 'Dependents'.  Yuri advised that the word Dependents will be confusing for the target uses, and suggested that we use a phrase like "Foster youth" or "Foster Children".  Better still, call it "Kids in home" and add a category of "foster kid, biological kid" etc.


Language needs for the users of the prototype: Ideally Spanish/English/Vietnamese/Hmong/Russian.  Add to backlog
